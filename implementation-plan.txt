IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: BACKPROPAGATION MUSEUM PROJECT

1. PROJECT CONTEXT AND CURRENT STATE

- Goal: Build an educational, interactive "museum" around the iconic Backpropagation and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithms, including code, narrative, and historical context.
- Current Assets:
    * mcp_server.py: FastAPI MCP server with tools for web/arXiv search, OpenAI code generation, LaTeX-to-code, and resource access.
    * BP.tex: Full LaTeX source of Werbos's BPTT paper, with equations and pseudocode.
    * BP_review.md: Detailed summary of BPTT, including mathematical and algorithmic insights.
    * requirements.txt, setup.ps1, config.env: Well-structured for ML, LLM, and documentation workflows.
    * Missing: No actual Python implementation of BPTT in the codebase yet; no educational notebooks or visualizations; no README.

2. OPPORTUNITIES FOR VALUABLE TASKS

A. Implement Werbos's Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) in Modern Python (NumPy)
   - Why: The core of the "museum" should be a faithful, well-documented, and educational implementation of BPTT, directly inspired by the equations and pseudocode in BP.tex.
   - How:
       * Extract the mathematical equations and pseudocode from BP.tex and BP_review.md.
       * Implement a minimal, transparent NumPy version of BPTT for a simple RNN.
       * Include comments and docstrings referencing the original equations.
       * Optionally, provide a Jupyter notebook for step-by-step demonstration.

B. LaTeX-to-Code Extraction Tool
   - Why: Automate the conversion of LaTeX equations (from BP.tex) into executable Python/NumPy code, leveraging the server's latex_to_code tool.
   - How:
       * Parse BP.tex for key equations.
       * Use the MCP server's tool to generate code.
       * Validate and document the generated code.

C. Educational Notebook/Visualization
   - Why: Make the concepts accessible to learners by visualizing the forward and backward passes, gradients, and temporal unrolling.
   - How:
       * Create a Jupyter notebook in notebooks/ that walks through BPTT on a toy sequence problem.
       * Use matplotlib for visualizations.

D. Project README and Documentation
   - Why: The README is currently empty; a clear, inviting README is essential for onboarding and project clarity.
   - How:
       * Summarize the project, its goals, and how to run the server and code.
       * Link to BP.tex, BP_review.md, and any implemented code/notebooks.

E. Claude Code MCP Server Integration
   - Why: As per instructions.txt, install and run the Claude code MCP server for Anthropic integration.
   - How:
       * Follow setup instructions for the Claude MCP server.
       * Add configuration and test endpoints.

3. CHOSEN TASK: IMPLEMENT BPTT IN MODERN PYTHON (NUMPY)

Rationale:
Implementing BPTT in Python/NumPy is the most foundational and educational task. It directly supports the museum's mission, leverages the provided LaTeX and review materials, and creates a base for further educational content and tools.

Next Steps:
- Extract equations and pseudocode from BP.tex and BP_review.md.
- Write a minimal, well-commented NumPy implementation of BPTT.
- Document the code with references to the original paper.
- (Optional) Create a Jupyter notebook for demonstration and visualization.
