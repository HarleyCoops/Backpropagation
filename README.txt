üß† Backpropagation Museum Project

## What is This?

Welcome to the Backpropagation Museum ‚Äî a living, interactive homage to one of the most important algorithms in the history of artificial intelligence: Backpropagation and its extension, Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).

This project is both a technical implementation and a digital museum. It brings together:
- The original Werbos BPTT paper in LaTeX (BP.tex)
- A modern, readable summary (BP_review.md)
- Faithful, well-documented NumPy code for BPTT (bptt_numpy.py)
- An advanced MCP server (mcp_server.py) that enables LLM-powered code generation, LaTeX-to-code conversion, and web search
- Setup scripts, configuration, and a vision for educational, historical, and technical exploration

## Why a Museum?

Backpropagation is the algorithm that made deep learning possible. BPTT extended it to recurrent neural networks, enabling machines to learn from sequences and time. This project is a tribute to the pioneers, a resource for learners, and a toolkit for researchers.

We are "sapiens paying homage to the emerging consciousness in AI."
Explore, learn, and help tell the story.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the Repository

    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd Backpropagation

2. Setup the Environment (Windows/PowerShell)

    pwsh setup.ps1

    - Installs dependencies in a virtual environment
    - Sets up config files and directories
    - Tests the MCP server and Jupyter kernel

3. Edit Configuration

    - Open .env (copied from config.env)
    - Add your OpenAI and Anthropic API keys for LLM-powered features

4. Run the MCP Server

    python mcp_server.py

    - Visit http://localhost:8000/health for status
    - The server exposes endpoints for LLM tools, LaTeX-to-code, and more

5. Explore the BPTT Implementation

    python bptt_numpy.py

    - Trains a simple RNN using BPTT on a toy sequence
    - See bptt_numpy.py for code, comments, and usage
